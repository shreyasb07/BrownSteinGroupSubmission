# BrownSteinGroupSubmission
A website created from a mock up of a PSD file using HTML, CSS and Javascript provided by Will Murdoch.

Image carousel with slider effect has been placed at the top of the page.
NavBar consists of links that on hover scale uptp 1.2 times and has a RED bar above the <a> tags.
A span with a psedudo element has been used to obtain the Red bar above the <a> tags in the navbar.
Similarly a smaller red bar is placed above 'We'in the following paragraph that tells us about the author.

The author's image has been put into a circle as can be seen from the mockup and his signature is aligned center below the image.
Likewise the rest of the mock up has been successfully converted and developed into a functional website.

The buttons along with the social icons have been given a hover effect of transform:scale(1.2)

The address at the footer has been linked to the Google Map of the location.

The button under 'Subscription' takes us to the Mailing list page on the link that has been provided by Will in the instruction sheet.
