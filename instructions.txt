Garces Landing Page Instructions

OVERALL:
- Try to match the design as closely as possible
- Font in the design is Myriad Pro, bonus points if you want to add a webfont
- Links can be placeholders, use whatever you want, or nothing (as long as they are still anchor tags)
- There is no mobile design, I'm sad too. Use your best judgement for responsiveness, we have to do this more often than not
- We like animations. Feel free to add them where you think they would look nice.
- All images were rasterized to make the PSD a reasonable download for you. The doc is only 1400px wide, so if images are blurry at larger resolutions don't worry about it
- When complete, push the site to Github (public is fine) and send a link to wmurdoch@brownsteingroup.com + mhegarty@brownsteingroup.com

NAVIGATION:
- Nav items should have hover state matching active element (red with a red stroke above)
- Take any approach you want to the mobile nav, no design provided

HEADER:
- Carousel of 4 images, each is in a folder labeled image 1-4
- Count in slide navigation should match the active slide
- Should transition between frames, cross-fade is fine but bonus points for creativity

ORANGE INTRO/GRID:
- For consistency, the 3-across grid should become a single column with text first, then image on mobile. This is to match the headshot section above it

RED TWITTER FEED:
- Match the overall section layout, but the Twitter feed itself can look however you want, was used for placement only in design

FOOTER:
- All info should still be available on mobile
- Link the address to a Google map
- Mailing list should drive here https://us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cc665980d764a22988bd828e7&id=31a071b5d3
